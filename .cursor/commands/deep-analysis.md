You are Cursor Agent. Today’s task is **READ-ONLY ANALYSIS**. Do not write, edit, stage, commit, run tools that modify files, or execute code that changes state. Wait for explicit approval before any changes.

## Scope to Analyze
- Attach and analyze the entire repository root using @Folders for full structure and file inventory:
  - @Folders: ./
- Include all source directories (e.g., src, app, pages, server, lib, components, hooks, utils), configuration (e.g., package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.*, env samples), tests, and any infra (Docker, CI).
- Include /docs (or “docs”) and any *.md/*.mdx documentation files.

## Method (No assumptions)
1) **Enumerate** every directory and file. Build a precise map:
   - Tree of folders & files (summarized, but complete at top-level; expand deeper where logic lives).
   - Key frameworks/libraries, runtime(s), build tools.
2) **Understand app logic & data flow (factual only):**
   - Entry points, routing, main components/pages.
   - State management, hooks, services, context, middleware.
   - Data sources, schemas, types, API endpoints, fetch flows, caching, error handling.
   - Background jobs/cron, queues, webhooks (if present).
   - Security surfaces: auth/session, role checks/guards, secrets usage, CORS, rate limits.
   - Performance aspects: bundle size risks, N+1 queries, repeated network calls, expensive renders.
3) **Identify TODO/FIXME markers & known gaps** present in code/comments.

> Critical rule: If something is not explicitly present in the codebase or settings, **do not infer**. Say “unknown/not found” instead of assuming.

## Deliverables (as output in chat, do not apply changes)
**A. Current State Summary (structured)**
- Project overview: tech stack, versions (if available), monorepo/modules.
- App architecture: layers, modules, key files, routing map.
- Data flow diagram (text-based) from source → transformations → sinks/UI.
- Build/test/deploy pipeline summary (if any).
- Known feature flags/configs.

**B. Documentation Update Proposal (non-destructive)**
- If a documentation folder (e.g., `docs/`) or root README exists:
  - Propose edits as **unified diff patches** for each affected file (e.g., `docs/overview.md`, `README.md`).
  - Keep changes minimal, accurate, dated (ISO 8601), and include a short changelog line at top.
  - If no docs exist, propose a new `docs/overview.md` as a full file content block (do not write to disk).

**C. Issues & Improvements**
- **Bugs/potential errors**: list file:line with short diagnosis and why it’s risky.
- **Optimizations**: performance, DX, code-style/consistency, dead code, large components to split, etc.
- **Security & privacy**: secrets handling, authz gaps, unsafe APIs, third-party risks.
- **Testing gaps**: what to cover (unit/integration/e2e) with suggested test names.

**D. Next Actions (PAUSE)**
- Provide a short, numbered action plan (from low-risk to high-impact).
- End with:  
  **“Paused. I will not change files until you say ‘apply step X’.”**

## C. Issues & Improvements
- [Type] file:line — finding — rationale — suggested fix (no code changes yet)

## D. Next Actions (PAUSE)

- Paused. I will not change files until you say ‘apply step X’.

## Hard Rules
- READ-ONLY: Do not modify, stage, commit, or run formatters/linters that write files.
- Do not fabricate file contents or infer behavior. If unknown, state “unknown/not found”.
- If repository is large, chunk the analysis but still cover 100% of files logically (summarize trivial/asset files).
- Ask for explicit approval before any code or documentation changes are applied.
